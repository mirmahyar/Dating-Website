A tinder - like website ! 
Of course, it is only front end design, with swiping right and left dunctionalities. 
Created by React, Material-ui. 
I also wrote the Server, but I didn't deploy it. So, if someone wants to use it with back-end, the only step needed is to create a mongodb instance, fetching data from mongodb with the endpoints already written in server.js file.
